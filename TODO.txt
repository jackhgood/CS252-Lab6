High-level things that need done:

*come up with a name for the game and replace "SpringMVCTest" with it
-test robustness on Bluemix
-investigate further into MongoDB--figure out if it's good for JSON, and if so, get it set up
	subnote: will it only work when the app is deployed on Bluemix? That would be annoying
-investigate the possibility of the Bluemix SSO service for keeping track of level creators
